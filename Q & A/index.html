    <h1>Q-1 What is ReactJs..?</h1> <br>
    <p>React.js, commonly known as React, is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It was developed by Facebook and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. <br>
        Here are the key features and concepts of React: <br>

       1:->> Component-Based Architecture: <br>
        (i) Components: React allows developers to build encapsulated components that manage their own state and then compose them to create complex UIs. A component can be a class or a function that returns a React element. <br>
        (ii)Reusability: Components can be reused throughout the application, making the code more modular and maintainable. <br>

       2:- JSX (JavaScript XML): <br>
       JSX is a syntax extension that looks similar to XML or HTML and is used with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX makes the code easier to understand and debug. <br>
       const element = <h2>Hello, world!</h2>;
    </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-2 What is NPM in ReactJs..?</h1> <br> 
    <p>The command npm is used to download JavaScript packages from Node Package Manager <br>
    ->>NPM is the world's largest software Library. <br>
    ->>NPM is online directory that contains the various already registered open-source packages.
    </p> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-3 What is Role of Node Js in react Js..?</h1>  <br>
    <p>
     ->>Node.js plays a significant role in the development and deployment of React.js applications.<br>
     ->>The role of Node js in react js is run our application on server-side-browser.
     </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-4 What is CLI command In React Js..?</h1> <br>
    <p>
     ->>In React.js, CLI (Command Line Interface) commands are used to interact with various tools and libraries, manage project dependencies, run development servers, build projects, and more. The most common CLI tool associated with React.js is Create React App (CRA), which simplifies the process of setting up a new React project.   
    </p>       
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-5 What is Components in React Js..?</h1> <br>
    <p>
        ->>In React.js, components are the building blocks of the user interface. They encapsulate the structure, logic, and behavior of a portion of the UI, making it easier to build complex and reusable interfaces. Components can be thought of as custom HTML elements, and they come in two main types: functional components and class components. 
    </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-6 What is Header and Content Components in React Js..?</h1> <br>
    <p>
        ->>In React.js, components like Header and Content are typically used to structure the user interface of a web application. These components are often designed to be reusable and composable, enabling developers to build complex UIs in a modular and maintainable way.
    </p>

    <h1>Q-7 How to install React Js on Windows, Linux Operating System? How to Install NPM and How to check version of NPM?</h1> <br>
    <p>
        ->>Step-1 :  Install node js latest version from google for windows or Linux. <br>
        ->> Step-2 :  Install node packge module on your device using command npm install. <br>
        ->>Step-3 :  After complt instaletation open command panel and type npm -v for check version of node js installed.
    </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-8 How to check version of React Js..?</h1> <br>
    <p>
        ->>S-1 Open your project directory. <br>
           S-2 Open the package.json file. <br>
           S-3 Look for the react and react-dom entries under the dependencies section. It should look something like this: <br>
           { <br>
            "dependencies": { <br>
              "react": "^17.0.2", <br>
              "react-dom": "^17.0.2", <br>
              // other dependencies...
            } <br>
          }
    </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
    <h1>Q-9 How to change in components of React Js..?</h1> <br>
    <p>
        ->>To change or update components in a React.js application, you typically edit the component's code by modifying its structure, props, state, or lifecycle methods. <br>
        (1):-Open the Project Directory: <br>
        Navigate to the directory where your React.js project is located. <br>
        (2):-Locate the Component: <br>
        Find the component file you want to change. Components are usually stored in the src directory. <br>
        (3):-Edit the Component Code: <br>
        Open the component file in your code editor. Make the necessary changes to the component.
